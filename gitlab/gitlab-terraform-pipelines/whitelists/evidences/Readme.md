# False positive claims

In this evidence folder, after scanning the source codes, ensure developers address any identified vulnerabilities. If any vulnerabilities cannot be resolved, provide a justification to the product owner and obtain confirmation via email. Take a screenshot of the confirmation email and save it in the appropriate folder structure under the name of the CVE or ID. Additionally, update the relevant CVE or ID in the corresponding text file to exclude it from future scans.
