# gitlab-iac-scan false positive claims

In this evidence folder, after gitlab IaC scanning the source codes, ensure developers address any identified vulnerabilities. If any vulnerabilities cannot be resolved, provide a justification to the product owner and obtain confirmation via email. Take a screenshot of the confirmation email and save it in the `gitlab-iac-sast-scan` folder structure under the name of the CVE or ID. Additionally, update the relevant CVE or ID in the `gitlab-iac-sast-whitelist.txt` file to exclude it from future scans.
